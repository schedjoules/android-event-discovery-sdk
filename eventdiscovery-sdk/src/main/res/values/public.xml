    <!--

    These resources below are explicitly marked as public here,
    so they can be overridden in the client of the SDK for customization.
    (See https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library.html#PrivateResources)

    The plan is to keep them stable (no name or usage change) over the releases,
    so clients can depend on them.

    All other resources could be overridden as well, but only at your own risk,
    we can't guarantee that they are not changed later.
    (They will also generate a Lint warning about using private resource.)
